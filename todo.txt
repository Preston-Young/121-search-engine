Milestone 3:

1. Store doc_id map in file(s)
2. Optimize query
    2a. Lec 17 Slide 29 being more efficient with AND query
    2b. Phrase queries?
    2c. Bigrams?
    2d. Rank importance by proximity for phrase queries
3. Get partial and merge index working
4. Positional indexes?
5. Index the index (seek): Lecture 8 Slide 15
6. Save partial index
7. Read in from partial indicies as opposed to the large file, i.e. ("apple" is from a.txt)
8. Uncomment the partial index logic to ensure that merging and retrieving works properly


Fixing issue with large index:
1. Store url_to_id map in a JSON file - DONE
2. Index:
    a. Load index file as JSON binary at the top of search.py
    b. Make a new file for helper functions
        a. Check if key exists in JSON binary
        b. Fetch key and return decoded python dict
    c. Edit search.py to work with new index helper
